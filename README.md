# RenderLib-Minecraft-Development
It can be quite annoying to set-up RenderLib in a specific Minecraft version. This is why i chose to make this Repository.
This repository holds ready to use Minecraft modding development kit's with pre-installed versions of RenderLib.

# What is RenderLib?
[RenderLib](https://gitlab.com/FriedrichS/renderlib/-/tree/polishing_fixes) is a small lightweight rendering engine written in pure Java and is highly optimized.
