# RenderLib-Minecraft-Development
This repository holds ready to use Minecraft modding development kit's with pre-installed versions of RenderLib.

# What is RenderLib?
RenderLib is a small lightweight rendering engine written in pure Java and is highly optimized. Because of its high level of abstraction it should be simple to use.
The set of features it provides will be expanded in the future. Changes made partially depend on the feedback and requests for RenderLib.
