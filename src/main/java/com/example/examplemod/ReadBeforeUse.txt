If you want to load your models from the final mod jar file, you
will have to change the loading method in RenderLib.ModelInfos and
make sure that the JAR_NAME in ExampleMod is always the same as the
name of your mod jar file.

Use shadowJar for building!
- Tasks/shadow/shadowJar
The output file will be in build/libs

There is a rendering code example in ExampleMod and a showcase world.
